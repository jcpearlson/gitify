# TODO

- add no positional arguments has ascii art at top, also maybe add to readme and project files.

- fix config to accept multiple api sources, also expand llm.py to use them as well (maybe make distinct files ie: openai.py anthropic.py google.py and ollama.py)
- Create auto readme.md command
- Cool future work: create some type of Evals folder that automatically runs evals on various commit diffs and checks its performance using llm as a judge.
